Functional programming: every function is pure
Actors model

Experimental: Given a future fut, a continuation is added with the call
fut.then(continuation).
Continuation is run on an unspecified thread.

Continuations can be chained to eliminate threads blocking.

Waiting for all the futures in the loop is ineffecient
std::experimental::when_all

when_any waits for one future from a collection to be ready

A latch is a syn-
chronization object that becomes ready when its counter is decremented to zero.

Whereas a latch doesn’t care which
threads decrement the counter—the same thread can decrement the counter multi-
ple times, or multiple threads can each decrement the counter once, or some combi-
nation of the two—with barriers, each thread can only arrive at the barrier once per
cycle.
