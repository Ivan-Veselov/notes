A reference is not an object. Instead, a reference is just another name for an
already existing object.

A reference may be bound only to an
object, not to a literal or to the result of a more general expression.

int *&r = p;   // r is a reference to the pointer p

extern const int bufSize = fcn(); // without extern const value is local to file

int i = 42;
const int &r1 = i;      // we can bind a const int& to a plain int object

int *const curErr = &errNumb;  // curErr will always point to errNumb
